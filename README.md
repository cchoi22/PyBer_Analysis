# PyBer_Analysis

## 1. Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the rider and driver data across different city types for a ride sharing app. Data was consolidated into a summary table as well as a line chart that tracked the fare amount across 6 months. 
## 2. Results
Based on the summary table below it appears that original assumptions regarding ride sharing utilization was correct. Rural areas had the least amount of riders and drivers. While urban areas had the most riders and drivers.

The summary table also showed that the most fares came from urban areas while the average driver fare is lower than rural areas. This was due to the greater supply of driver base. The average fares in rural areas were greater than urban areas, this could be due to the greater distance travelled or due to the reduced amount of supply of drivers in the area.

Based on the Fares vs Time line chart it can be seen that the peak utilization based on total fare amounts occur at the end of Febuary, closer to March time frame. Urban total fares fluctuate the most compared to Suburban and Rural areas.

## 3. Summary
Based on the data, Suburban and Urban areas provide the most revenue potential compared to rural areas. It is recommended to target these two types of cities for surge pricing to improve revenues. The average fare per ride or urban and suburban areas seem to be less due to the distance traveled. Therefor pricing can be adjusted to match rural areas if needed. 

For rural areas reducing the prices could induce an increase of demand for the service. The target utilization would be to match suburban levels.

Seasonal or monthly incentives could also be used to boost utilization in lower months such as March and April. Where the chart shows a dip in total fares.
